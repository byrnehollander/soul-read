Note that you can use it on the opponent\'s turn, though only on instants. Those are what work most naturally with the card, and this makes the opponent\'s life very difficult. You basically have a face-up hand full of combat tricks, so even the threat of them is valuable.

It replaces itself immediately, gets you to the six mana you need to start buying it back and sounds like the perfect way for a control deck to get really obnoxious.

That may sound weird, given that I spent probably hours of my time on stream explaining why Ravenform sucked, but therein lies the power of Lessons. This card gets to chill in your sideboard until you run into the spot where it\u2019s good, costing you very little in the process. This effect can definitely be strong, and not having to waste a draw on this when it isn\u2019t good is a really solid upside.

It grows a creature quickly and lets it defend, which will really run away with the game if you play it on turn three (preferably after a two-drop). Picking up a Lesson for free doesn\'t hurt, and this is a fantastic card overall."},{"name":"Star Pupil","manaCost":"{W}","colors":["W"],"cmc":1,"rarity":"common","image":"https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/normal/front/9/9/99e9318f-2e17-4b6e-895f-c17cd5d0d282.jpg?1617445328","types":["Creature"],"rating":1.5,"ratingDescription":"If this is the Star Pupil, no wonder Strixhaven is losing to [totally not] Voldemort (note that I don\'t know the storyline past what I\'ve seen on the flavor text, so I\'m just guessing here).

A 1/3 flyer for two isn\'t a bad deal, and the odds that it messes with your opponent are pretty high.

It\'s not exactly a nightmare for your opponent, as they can likely kill it without much trouble, but dying only to spells means it\'s at least trading for something.

It\'s an expensive card draw spell that offers a cheaper buyout of giving the opponent some scrys and Treasure, which you\'ll want to try and avoid if possible.

Given enough Pests and Unwilling Ingredients, you can take over the world with Daemogoth Titan.
